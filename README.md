# Resources for Peck App

This repository contains information about the various services and technologies that Peck will be using this summer.

Check out the Wiki for information about databases, our webservice, versioning systems, and system administration resources.

## Key Familiarities

All of the developers this summer should have an understanding of these technologies that are integral to the work we will be doing.

- Git versioning control
- HTML syntax and analysis, how the web works
- Ruby Language and Ruby on Rails
 - at least a general overview of how the system works
- Relational Database design, SQL language
 - how they work and how they are accessed
